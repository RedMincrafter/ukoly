This is a project aimed towards providing more information and assistance to students in the UK studying for the British Informatics Olympiad. It is not currently endorsed as an official resource by the BIO website, but it is created by various members of the community, many of whom are BIO finalists.

# Current Features
On the 'Round 1' and 'Round 2' pages, you can see a list of the problems which have editorials written for them so far. For each problem, you can see the editorial author(s), solution author(s), which year the problem came from and a list of tags for the problem. When you click 'View' on one of the problems, the editorial will be rendered in the problem viewer. You can sort, search and filter the list of problems to find specific ones.

# Upcoming Features
1. Having a grader for the publicly-available BIO1 test data per problem.
